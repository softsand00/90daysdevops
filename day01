Introduction of Devops

* What is DevOps?
Devops is a chain between development and Operation. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and monitoring to ensure that software is built, tested,
and released quickly and reliably. Its goal is to shorten the software development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

* What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure:
Automation: In technology, automation refers to using tools and scripts to perform tasks automatically, without human intervention.
Scaling: Scaling involves adjusting the capacity of your IT resources (like servers, databases, and applications) to handle an increase or decrease in demand
Infrastructure: Infrastructure in IT refers to the foundational hardware, software, networks, and facilities that
support the operation of an organization's IT environment.

* Why DevOps is Important:
DevOps is important because it helps companies release software faster and with fewer errors. 
It encourages teamwork between developers and IT staff, making processes more efficient. By automating tasks, 
DevOps reduces mistakes and improves the quality of the software. It also makes it easier to scale up systems as needed and 
saves money by streamlining operations. Overall, DevOps creates a smoother workflow, allowing for quicker innovation.
